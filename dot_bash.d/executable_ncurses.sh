    # ncurses is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
    # because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
    # parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

    # If you need to have ncurses first in your PATH run:

    [[ -d /usr/local/opt/ncurses/bin ]] &&
        export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ncurses/bin:$PATH"

    # For compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:
    #   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib"
    #   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include"

    # For pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:
    #   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig"
